## Hi.

I'm James, a developer living in California.

I mostly work in [Python](https://www.python.org/), with [the Django
web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/), for which I've served
in many leadership roles including committer, release manager,
technical board member and security response team member.

In addition to several popular reusable Django applications, I also
maintain a couple of pure Python libraries, and I occasionally
[blog](https://www.b-list.org/).

I usually only find time for open source work on weekends, so that's
when you're most likely to see me committing or responding to
discussions.

Currently I'm working on:

* A significant update to
  [django-registration](https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-registration);
  the base forms and custom-user support have been completely redone
  to be more robust, and the activation workflow is now being
  rewritten for better HTTP practices.
  
* Deprecating Python 3.8 support from all my projects and
  adding/marking Python 3.13 support.
