Hi. I'm James, a developer living in California.

I mostly work in [Python](https://www.python.org/), with [the Django
web framework](https://www.djangoproject.com/), for which I've served
in many leadership roles including committer, release manager,
technical board member and security response team member.


## Key projects

I maintain several popular reusable Django applications:

* [django-contact-form](https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-contact-form)
  is a configurable contact-form application.
  
* [django-registration](https://github.com/ubernostrum/django-registration)
  is a highly customizable user-registration application.
  
* [pwned-passwords-django](https://github.com/ubernostrum/pwned-passwords-django)
  is an integration for Django's password validation system to check
  against [the Pwned Passwords database](https://haveibeenpwned.com/Passwords).
  
I also maintain some general Python libraries:

* [akismet](https://github.com/ubernostrum/akismet) provides API
  clients for [the Akismet spam-filtering service](https://akismet.com).
  
* [webcolors](https://github.com/ubernostrum/webcolors) provides tools
  for parsing and converting HTML/CSS color formats.
  
I usually only find time for open source work on weekends, so that's
when you're most likely to see me committing or responding to
discussions.


## Currently working on:

* A major new version of django-registration, with much-improved
  custom user-model support and a better-designed activation workflow.
  
* Updating all of my projects to support Django 5.1, and also to
  support Python 3.13 and drop Python 3.8.

I occasionally [blog](https://www.b-list.org) about technical topics,
or [post about them on Mastodon](https://infosec.exchange/@ubernostrum).
